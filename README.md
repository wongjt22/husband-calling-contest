## ⚙️ Project Configuration
### React + TypeScript
- Benefits of strong typesafety.
- '@' alias to simply imports and make the codebase more readable.
### Prettier
- Code formatting, ensuring consistent code style.

## 🗄️ Project Structure

Most of the code lives in the `src` folder and looks like this:

```sh
src
|
+-- assets            # assets folder can contain all the static files such as images, fonts, etc.
|
+-- components        # shared components used across the entire application
|
+-- features          # feature based modules
|

+-- routes            # routes configuration
```
