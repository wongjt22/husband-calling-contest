# 🗄️ Project Structure

Most of the code lives in the `src` folder and looks like this:

```sh
src
|
+-- assets            # assets folder can contain all the static files such as images, fonts, etc.
|
+-- components        # shared components used across the entire application
|
+-- features          # feature based modules
|

+-- routes            # routes configuration
```
